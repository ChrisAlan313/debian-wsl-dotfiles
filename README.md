## What's the purpose?

I'm using this repo to store important files for the debian WSL on my PC. If this gets dropped for whatever reason, I want to have something to rebuild with.

This isn't automated in any way and is for copy-pasting.

This is the instance I'm using for a couple things. First and foremost, it's for learning C and going through Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. Second, I'm playing around with neovim and the terminal. Mainly to learn, but also because it's just fun.
